“Make every small Indian job-work unit as predictable, reliable, and data-driven as a large OEM plant.”

We want JobWork Planner to become the default operating system for job-work units:

Replace Excel + whiteboards + WhatsApp with a single live system.

Give owners & OEMs clear visibility.

Collect enough data to enable optimization & AI in later versions.
